The code attempts to install pip via `ensurepip` or `get-pip.py`, but this fails due to network timeout or mirror issues.\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd `pip` as a project dependency in `pyproject.toml`:\r\n```toml\r\n[project]\r\ndependencies = [\r\n    \"pip>=25.3\",\r\n    # ... other dependencies\r\n]\r\nThis ensures pip is available when running uv sync, fixing the plugin dependency installation.\r\nFuture Improvement (Optional)\r\nFor a more robust solution, consider updating backend/plugin/requirements.py to use uv pip install instead of pip install:\r\n# Change from:\r\nsubprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-r', requirements_file])\r\n# To:\r\nsubprocess.run(['uv', 'pip', 'install', '-r', requirements_file], check=True)\r\nThis would unify dependency management under uv and avoid pip/uv conflicts.\r\nTesting Steps\r\n1. Create a new project with uv\r\n2. Run uv run fba init --auto\r\n3. Verify plugin dependencies are installed successfully\r\n4. Run uv run fba run to confirm the application starts",

The code attempts to install pip via `ensurepip` or `get-pip.py`, but this fails due to network timeout or mirror issues.\r\n### Solution\r\nAdd `pip` as a project dependency in `pyproject.toml`:\r\n```toml\r\n[project]\r\ndependencies = [\r\n    \"pip>=25.3\",\r\n    # ... other dependencies\r\n]\r\nThis ensures pip is available when running uv sync, fixing the plugin dependency installation.\r\nFuture Improvement (Optional)\r\nFor a more robust solution, consider updating backend/plugin/requirements.py to use uv pip install instead of pip install:\r\n# Change from:\r\nsubprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-r', requirements_file])\r\n# To:\r\nsubprocess.run(['uv', 'pip', 'install', '-r', requirements_file], check=True)\r\nThis would unify dependency management under uv and avoid pip/uv conflicts.\r\nTesting Steps\r\n1. Create a new project with uv\r\n2. Run uv run fba init --auto\r\n3. Verify plugin dependencies are installed successfully\r\n4. Run uv run fba run to confirm the application starts",
